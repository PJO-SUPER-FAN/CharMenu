# Character Menu for Most FNF Engines

Just as the name explains, this should be a working character menu for most of the engines for FNF
The Original Character Menu Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/TorchTheDragon/FNFTorchEdition) and the Video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/66AcG4_wd6E)

## Why did I do this again?

Actually I have a very simple reason...

I am just simply tired of being asked "Does this work on Psych?" a YEAR after I had created this, which should show that now that version is more than likely OBSOLETE and thus shouldn't be asked A YEAR LATER "dOeS tHiS wOrK wItH pSyCh EnGiNe?/??"

## Why was I rude in that previous statement?

I'm just annoyed at the question. I am not usually rude and will try to help when asked, but I just hated it when I have to tell everyone multiple times that I don't know if it works. This is primarily because I honestly just prefer Kade over the other versions, but I am also not really an FNF modder, so I guess it is what it is.

# Can I just drag and drop the file into the Mods folder?

No

# Can you make this compatible to put in the mods folder

No, it is impossible for me, mainly cuz I suck with lua so idk if it is possible, but I don't think it is
