# Character Menu for Most FNF Engines

Just as the name explains, this should be a working character menu for most of the engines for FNF
The Original Character Menu Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/TorchTheDragon/FNFTorchEdition) and the Video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/66AcG4_wd6E).

# Why did I do this again?

Actually I have a very simple reason...

I am just simply tired of being asked "Does this work on Psych?" a YEAR after I had created this, which should show that now that version is more than likely OBSOLETE and thus shouldn't be asked A YEAR LATER "dOeS tHiS wOrK wItH pSyCh EnGiNe?/??"

# Does it work with Psych Engine?

Soon, hopefuly, but right now, no.

# Can I just drag and drop the file into the Mods folder?

No.

# Can you make this compatible to put in the mods folder

No, it is impossible for me, mainly cuz I suck with lua so idk if it is possible, but I don't think it is.
