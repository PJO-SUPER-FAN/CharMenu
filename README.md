## Character Menu for Most FNF Engines

Just as the name explains, this should be a working character menu for most of the engines for FNF.
The Original Character Menu Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/TorchTheDragon/FNFTorchEdition) and the Video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/66AcG4_wd6E).

## #Why did I do this again?

Actually I have a very simple reason...

I am just simply tired of being asked "Does this work on Psych?" a YEAR after I had created this, which should show that now that version is more than likely OBSOLETE and thus shouldn't be asked A YEAR LATER "dOeS tHiS wOrK wItH pSyCh EnGiNe?/??"

### Does it work with Psych Engine?

Yes, now please stop asking. [Instructions](./Instructions/Psych/)

### Can I just drag and drop the file into the Mods folder?

No. Follow the instructions for the Engine.

### There are no Instructions for my engine though.

Well, I haven't made all of them yet, I have to make the CharMenu compatible first.

### Will there be video instructions?

### Can you make this compatible to put in the Mods folder?

No.
